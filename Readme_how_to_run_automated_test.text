There are two <.feature> file in the automation repo code:

1. ui_test_automation_part_b1.feature -> This file conatin test related to UI automation as per part Part B.1
2. api_testing_part_c1.feature -> -> This file conatin test realted to UI API testing as per Part C.1 

Read the above feature files to know what test has been covered


Steps to run Automated test:


1.
Please first download "chromedriver.exe" from "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads" based on Operating system you are using.
Unzip the downloaded folder.

Download the Automation code send by me locally on your machine.
In automation code,Please ,Navigate to path -> assignment/steps/config/commonconfig.ini.
Now ,you need to configure the configuration file i.e. commonconfig.ini .
Here you will see variable with name-> chrome_exe_location_path.
Please remove the existing path and replace it with the path where "chromedriver.exe" is downloaded locally on machine from where you wnat to run.

2.
You also need to install python libraries into your python environment(assuming your system already have it or otherwise install it).
Install these below list of libraries:
behave -> pip install behave
selenium -> pip install selenium
requests -> pip install requests
random -> pip install random

3.
You are now ready to run test.
In behave whatever tag we define ,behave will run those set of test. Tag are always placed above test scenario in feature file.
For more info ,please check .feature file in automation repo.

We define tag as -t @<tagname> in behave run command
You can run specific UI test or all test all together sequentially located under ->ui_test_automation_part_b1.feature

Commands you can use to run :
To run UI test from -> ui_test_automation_part_b1.feature
To run only single test let say I want to run @TC-1 from ->ui_test_automation_part_b1.feature, use below command using test case tag.
behave src\features\ui_test_automation_part_b1.feature -t @TC-1 --no-skipped --no-capture

To run only all test  from ->ui_test_automation_part_b1.feature, use below command
behave src\features\ui_test_automation_part_b1.feature --no-skipped --no-capture


To run API test from -> api_testing_part_c1.feature, follow same approach as above:

If you want to run single test case, then use TC1 tag as @TC-1 as mentioned below:
behave src\features\api_testing_part_c1.feature -t @TC-1 --no-skipped --no-capture


To run only all test from ->api_testing_part_c1.feature, use below command
behave src\features\api_testing_part_c1.feature -t --no-skipped --no-capture
